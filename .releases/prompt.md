Ivy is an open source framework for building apps in pure .Net and C#. 

We have two repos that I have on my computer: 

D:\\Repos\\\_Ivy\\Ivy\\ #Contains CLI tools that are used by Ivy developers

and

D:\\Repos\\\_Ivy\\Ivy-Framework\\ #Fully open source

I want you to thoroughly go though ALL the commits in these two repos and write an article about all the changes that have been done since last friday that might be of interest to someone using the framework and the CLI. Keep each section short and descriptive. 

Write it all as a markdown article and use code block so show examples on how to use new APIs, etc. 

After: Make sure you didn't miss anything importantâ€”use the gh CLI to check for PRs.
